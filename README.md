### Welcome

This repository holds source files and instructions for my corresponding C programming course.

In order to get started  you need an **rpm** based linux system like CentOS.

Install the "Development Tools" then start coding!

``` bash
sudo su -
yum groupinstall "Development Tools" -y
```
